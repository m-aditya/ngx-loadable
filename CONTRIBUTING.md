# Contributing to ngx-loadable

Hello there. Thanks for taking time out to contribute to [ngx-loadable](https://github.com/mohammedzamakhan/ngx-loadable)!

We are open to any kind of contribution: code, documentation, bug-fixing (even just reports), feature-requests and anything else you may come up with.

## Coding

Nothing fancy here, just:

1. Fork this repo

2. Run `npm install` to install the relevant modules

3. Run `npm run build:lib` to build the ngx-loadable library

4. Run `npm start` to serve the project

5. Do your magic! âœ¨

6. Commit you code

7. Submit a pull request. It will be reviewed by maintainers and they'll give you proper feedback so you can iterate over it.

Please note: Any contributions you make are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers this project.

### Considerations

- Following [The seven rules of a great Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules) is highly encouraged

- When adding a new feature, branch from [master-branch](https://github.com/mohammedzamakhan/ngx-loadable/tree/master)

## Documenting

Code should be self-documented. But, in case there is any code that may be hard to understand, it must include some comments to make it easier to review and maintain later on.

## Reporting bugs

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background

- Steps to reproduce

- Be specific!

- Give sample code if you can.

- What you expected would happen

- What actually happens

- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
